# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.
function createSection creates new setion and append it to page main and creates nav icon to the section and append it to nave bar

I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.
function that run onscroll window and reset the active class and change it in nave bar

I made a button to create additional partitions.

I made an icon to go to the top of the page.
